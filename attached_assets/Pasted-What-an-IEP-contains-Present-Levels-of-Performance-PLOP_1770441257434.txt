What an IEP contains:

Present Levels of Performance (PLOP): A written description of where Carter is right now — academically, functionally, behaviorally. This is where all the data goes. Test scores, teacher observations, parent input, the works. This section should accurately describe the gap between his ability and his performance.
Annual Goals: Measurable goals for what Carter will achieve in one year with the support of the IEP. These are specific — not "Carter will improve in writing" but something like "Given a writing prompt and access to speech-to-text technology, Carter will produce a four-paragraph essay with a clear introduction, supporting details, and conclusion, scoring 3/4 or higher on the grade-level writing rubric, in 4 out of 5 opportunities."
Specially Designed Instruction (SDI): This is the actual teaching piece — what a special education teacher will do differently for Carter that the general education teacher isn't doing. For Carter, this might look like:

Direct instruction in writing process strategies from a special education teacher, maybe 30-60 minutes a few times per week in a pull-out or push-in model
Executive functioning skill instruction — explicit teaching of organizational systems, self-monitoring strategies, task completion routines
This is NOT a tutor. This is a special education teacher providing instruction specifically designed to address his disability-related deficits.


Related Services: Support services Carter needs to benefit from the SDI. For him, this could include:

Occupational therapy — to address the DCD and fine motor issues, and to help determine the right assistive technology
Assistive technology evaluation and services — determining what tools he needs (speech-to-text, keyboarding instruction, etc.) and training him to use them
School-based counseling — not to treat his anxiety, but to help him develop coping strategies for the emotional impact of his disabilities on his school experience


Accommodations: Changes to HOW Carter accesses instruction and demonstrates knowledge, without changing WHAT he's expected to learn. For him:

Extended time (50% was recommended in the eval)
Speech-to-text for all writing assignments
Option to respond orally instead of in writing for assessments
Reduced volume of written output (demonstrate mastery with fewer items)
Preferential seating
Chunked assignments with check-ins
A consistent organizational system (designated folder/location for completed work — this directly addresses the backpack/locker problem)
Copy of notes or note-taking support
Noise-canceling headphones if needed for focus


Progress Monitoring: How and how often the school will measure Carter's progress toward his goals. This is typically quarterly progress reports that come home with report cards.

What's Realistic vs. Aspirational
Here's where I have to be straight with you.
What you can realistically expect a public school to provide:

Accommodations — these are the easiest win and cost the school almost nothing. Extended time, speech-to-text, oral responses, organizational supports. Most schools will agree to these without much fight.
Some amount of specially designed instruction in writing — probably 30-60 minutes, 2-3 times per week, likely from the special education teacher in a resource room or push-in setting
An assistive technology evaluation — if you request it formally and cite the eval's recommendation
Basic organizational support — like a check-out system at the end of class where someone verifies Carter has turned in his work before he leaves

What you'll probably have to fight harder for:

Occupational therapy as a direct service (vs. consultation only)
Meaningful writing instruction that goes beyond worksheets — actual explicit instruction in the process of translating ideas into written text, with dictation strategies, structured frameworks, and practice
Counseling as a related service
The right amount of SDI minutes — schools will lowball this

What a public school probably won't provide but Carter might benefit from:

Truly individualized executive function coaching
Intensive writing instruction from someone who understands twice-exceptional learners specifically
Therapy for anxiety (this remains on you, outside of school)

How You Find Out What to Ask For
This is genuinely where an advocate or attorney earns their fee. Because the game is:

The school will offer the minimum they think you'll accept
You need to know what's reasonable to request and what the research supports for his profile
The IEP goals need to be written tightly enough that you can actually measure progress — vague goals let schools off the hook
Every service needs specified frequency, duration, and location (e.g., "30 minutes of specially designed instruction in written expression, 3 times per week, in the special education resource room" — not "writing support as needed")

If you have an advocate or attorney at the IEP development meeting, they will help you negotiate the minutes, push for specific services, and make sure the goals are measurable and ambitious enough to actually reflect Carter's ability level. Without someone who knows what "typical" looks like for a kid with this profile, you're guessing at what to ask for and the school will happily let you guess low.
The Biggest Thing
The IEP is a living document. It gets reviewed annually and can be amended at any time if it's not working. So you don't have to get it perfect on the first try. What you need is to get eligibility established, get services started, and then monitor and adjust.
The first IEP is almost never enough. But it's the door. Once you're through it, you have legal standing to demand more. Without it, you have nothing.
